# Image Analysis Files

These are the original files that are compiled in __main__.py in the NPC_Image_Analysis/src/NPCAnalysis

To run these files, you simply need to have the above files in the same directory and run Image_Analysis_App.py in the terminal ```python Image_Analysis_App.py``` and the application will run.
